# Problem
Lack of quick and accessible medium to report social inadequacies, crime, violence, etc. 
Citizens don't have any sense of security when they walk the streets; reports get to local authorities late.

# Proposed solution
A single platform, where citizens are aware of disasters, crime and violence in their vicinity. Citizens will also be 
able to influence governance by making the government aware of lacking amenities. In the effort to pursue safety and 
quick response time, citizens will be able to easily alert local authorites of insecurities, and tap into real-time feeds.

# Proposed stack
- React
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Linode

# Top-level folder structure
TBD
