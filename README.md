# Problem
The increase in crime in our communities means we need more security than ever. Our streets are not safe, neither are the places around us. We have lost friends due to their ignorance of the state of security around them. 

# Proposed solution
While a lot of citizen safety lies on the government, we believe that we, the citizens, could play a collective role in feeling safer. Being able to report fire incidents, missing persons, and being aware of nearby incidents as they happen will take the society steps further in democratizing policing. We propose a platform to alert citizens of incidents as they happen around them. The general public will also be able to make reports of incidents.
